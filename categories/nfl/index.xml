      <description>Going into the 2021 NFL Draft the Minnesota Vikings were looking to draft a handful of rookies who can eventually play a major role on the team. General Manager of the Minnesota Vikings and Head Coach Mike Zimmer did just that on draft night, with drafting a total of eleven players.
GM Rick Spielman shocked all Vikings fans in the first round of the draft by trading back picks from the 14th overall pick to the 23rd overall pick.</description>

From Hall of Famer Cris Carter to Justin Jefferson who is entering his second season in the league. For this project I wanted to look at three different Viking receivers and compare who each of their rookie seasons by looking at three main statistics: receptions, receiving yards, and touchdowns.</description>

      <description>All good things must come to an end, and that is what happened in the summer going into the 2020 NFL season with the New England Patriots quarterback for the past two decades, Tom Brady. After 20 seasons with the Patriots, Brady was able to give the city of New England six Super Bowl Championships, 13 AFC Championship games, while winning three the NFL MVP awards and Super Bowl MVP three times.</description>
