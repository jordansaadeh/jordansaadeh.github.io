      <description>Going into the 2021 NFL Draft the Minnesota Vikings were looking to draft a handful of rookies who can eventually play a major role on the team. General Manager of the Minnesota Vikings and Head Coach Mike Zimmer did just that on draft night, with drafting a total of eleven players.
GM Rick Spielman shocked all Vikings fans in the first round of the draft by trading back picks from the 14th overall pick to the 23rd overall pick.</description>

      <description>If you are as big as a Minnesota Vikings fan as I am, you would know that the Vikings have had their fair share of talented wide receivers in the past. From Hall of Famer Cris Carter to Justin Jefferson who is entering his second season in the league. For this project I wanted to look at three different Viking receivers and compare who each of their rookie seasons by looking at three main statistics: receptions, receiving yards, and touchdowns.</description>

      <description>All good things must come to an end, and that is what happened in the summer going into the 2020 NFL season with the New England Patriots quarterback for the past two decades, Tom Brady. After 20 seasons with the Patriots, Brady was able to give the city of New England six Super Bowl Championships, 13 AFC Championship games, while winning three the NFL MVP awards and Super Bowl MVP three times.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my first blog post, I hope youâ€™re as excited as I am as I document my thoughts, questions, and answers to those questions. I will as well be giving updates on my project that I will be working on, whether that is of I think found some fascinating that I never knew and want to share or anything else in that matter. The first question I look forward to answering in my first project is: Why the New England Patriots need Tom Brady at quarterback to win a Super Bowl.</description>
