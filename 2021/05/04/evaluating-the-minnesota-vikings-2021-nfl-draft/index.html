<p>Going into the 2021 NFL Draft the Minnesota Vikings were looking to draft a handful of rookies who can eventually play a major role on the team. General Manager of the Minnesota Vikings and Head Coach Mike Zimmer did just that on draft night, with drafting a total of eleven players.</p>
<p>GM Rick Spielman shocked all Vikings fans in the first round of the draft by trading back picks from the 14th overall pick to the 23rd overall pick. With their new draft pick in the draft the Vikings selected Christian Darrisaw, an offensive tackle from Virginia Tech. By taking Darrisaw with the 23rd pick in the draft the Vikings filled a much needed gap on their offensive line. At his time at Virginia Tech, Darrisaw allowed only seven sacks in 1,100 pass blocking snaps and none throughout the 2020 season. He was voted to the AP All-American second team and First Team All-ACC as well. Darrisaw is an athletically gifted tackle with potential through the roof, if everything plays out with him he should be seeing a starting role on the Minnesota Vikings during the 2021-2022 NFL season.</p>
<p>The draft pick that surprised all Minnesota Vikings fans is selecting Texas A&amp;M quarterback Kellen Mond. This comes to a shock for Vikings fans as current quarterback, Kirk Cousins, still has two years remaining on his contract but another season short of the playoffs may have head coach Mike Zimmer think twice about sticking with Cousins. Mond had quite the career at Texas A&amp;M, he threw for 9,661 passing yards while completing all his passes on a 59.0 percentage. Mond dual-threat style at quarterback is something Minnesota has not seen in decades and can bring a new dimension to the Vikings offense. Although Zimmer may be playing the long game with rookie quarterback Mond, Cousins should not be too worried about losing his starting spot anytime soon as Mond has shown he still needs time to develop to the NFL play style.</p>
<p>Overall, the Minnesota Vikings fan base should be pleased with the way General Manager Rick Spielman and Head Coach approached this yearâ€™s NFL draft. They selected eleven rookies, each with potential to make an impact on the team and fill major spots in all three phases of the game.</p>
