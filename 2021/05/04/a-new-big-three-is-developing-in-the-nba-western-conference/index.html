<p>If you are a Minnesota Timberwolves, you might know what this team has gone through in the last decade. From star players getting injured to star players being traded, we have seen it and been through it all. But right now there is a different type of energy about the Minnesota Timberwolves, one that gives fans hope that they have something to cheer about in the upcoming season.
That hope comes in the form of Karl-Anthony Towns, D’Angelo Russell, and Anthony Edwards. What seemed as if we are never going to watch these three play together this season, but now after all three players have been cleared of injuries toward the end of the season we have seen the potential this big three has.<br />
Another big change that the Timberwolves front office made midway through the season was the firing of head coach Ryan Saunders which led to the hiring of Toronto Raptors assistant coach, Chris Finch. Since Finch has been on the sideline for the Wolves we have seen many changes, specifically to their offense. We have seen a lot more plays and sets designed for Towns, Russell, and Edwards giving all three the option to score the ball almost every possession. While most defenses are concerned about the Wolves big three on offense it opens up scoring opportunities for the other two players on offense.
To make it this as simple as possible, the Minnesota Timberwolves trio can potentially be one of the league’s best offenses. Any three of those players can create their own shot when needed, play off-ball, be a part of the pick-and-roll, and control the tempo of the game.</p>
