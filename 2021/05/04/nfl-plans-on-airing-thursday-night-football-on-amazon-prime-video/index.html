<p>On Monday, the National Football League announced that Thursday Night Football, Primetime’s second most watched show that has been previously aired on Fox News will now be available only on Amazon Prime Video starting at the beginning of the 2022 NFL season.</p>
<p>The NFL and Amazon were originally going to start airing games at the beginning of 2023 season, but both companies have agreed to start one year earlier making the 2021 season the last year airing Thursday night games on Fox News.</p>
<p>Amazon first partnered with the NFL during the 2017 season as part of a tri-broadcast distrubution on Thursday nights. The games will be available to a national audience only at the start of the 2022 NFL season, however, the NFL has announced that they will broadcast games over the air in markets of participating teams for that week of the season.</p>
<p>With this deal Amazon made history by becoming the first all-streaming provider to carry a weekly package of NFL games. Amazon’s deal will now run 11 years. The Prime Video package is for 15 Thursday night games and one pre-season game each season. The company always intended to have an 11-year package but needed to wait for the NFL contract to expire with Fox.</p>
<p>With this deal, the NFL has now expanded its digital footprint to reach a broader audience and enhanced the ability of its media partners to manage and innovate around their production. The NFL continues to be the only sports league that delivers all of its regular season and playoff games in free, over the air television.</p>
